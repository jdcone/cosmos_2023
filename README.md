# Cosmos 2023 Python learning sequence for Week 1

 Interactive Jupyter notebooks for learning python for 2023 Cosmos  Cluster 5 : Biophysics.
 
 All students went through these notebooks in week 1 to get a basic understanding of the python language.
 For those students experienced with python, this was a refresher. Many students had experience with java or 
 another programming language and these notebooks highlight the differences in python. For students new to 
 programming (less than 10%) , additional help and guidance was provided.

## Sequence of Jupyter Notebooks for learning Python Basics: 


   Python variable types: strings, integers, floats, booleans [python\_types.ipynb]
 
   Python containers: lists, tuples, dictionaries [python\_containers.ipynb]

   Python controls: if-then statements, for loops, while loops [python\_controls.ipynb]

   Python functions: regular functions, lambda functions [python\_functions.ipynb]

   Python libraries: numpy (arrays), random, matplotlib [python\_libraries.ipynb]
  

## Python Exercises (solutions are provided)
